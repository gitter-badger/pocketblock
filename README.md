# PocketBlock
PocketBlock is a visual syntax for cryptographic engineering, for kids, for
everyone. It's purpose is to bridge the gap between classical and modern
cryptography, by capturing the complexities of the latter in a form as
easy-to-grasp as the former.

This repository contains a collection of source material (e.g., LaTeX/TikZ/PGF,
HTML, CSS, et cetera) for inclusion in security and privacy educational
curricula.
